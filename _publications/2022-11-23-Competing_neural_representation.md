excerpt: 'Changing your mind requires shifting the way streams of information lead to a decision. Using in silico experiments we show how the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits can feasibly implement shifts in the evidence accumulation process. When action contingencies change, dopaminergic plasticity redirects the balance of power, both within and between action representations, to divert the flow of evidence from one option to another. This finding predicts that when competition between action representations is highest, the rate of evidence accumulation is lowest. We then validate this prediction in a sample of homo sapiens as they perform an adaptive decision-making task while whole-brain hemodynamic responses are recorded. These results paint a holistic picture of how CBGT circuits manage and adapt the evidence accumulation process in mammals.'
